    There are three articles in the <span class="span1" >English</span>  language: the, a, and an. These are divided into two types of articles: definite the and indefinite 
    The definite article indicates a level of specificity that the indefinite does not.
     “An apple” could refer to any apple <span class="span2" > however “the apple” is referring back to a specific apple. </span> 
    
    Thus, when using the definite article, the speaker assumes the listener knows the identity of the nouns referent
    because it is obvious, because it is common knowledge, or because it was mentioned in the same sentence or an earlier sentence.
    Use of an indefinite article implies that the speaker assumes the listener does not have to be told the identity of the referent.
